## Token Discovery Lab

| Document | English Tokens | English Cost | Your Language | Tokens | Cost | Difference | % Increase |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Doc 1 | 149 | $0.00447 | NL | 168 | $0.00504 | $0.00057 | 12.75% |
| Doc 2 | 98 | $0.00294 | NL | 143 | $0.00429 | $0.00135 | 45.92% |
| Doc 3 | 155 | $0.00465 | NL | 223 | $0.00669 | $0.00204 | 43.87% |

1. The second document has the biggest increase, about 45.92%
2. The third document is the most expensive, and would make an end of year difference of $2.04 ($6.69 - $4.65)
3. The language should be standard in English with a language option in Dutch

## Cost Modeling Lab

### Step 1: Monthly Token Volume

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total input tokens/month | 6,000,000 |
| Total output tokens/month | 12,000,000 |

### Step 2: Pricing per Tier (per million tokens)

| Tier | Input | Output | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Budget | 60 | 240 | 300 |
| Standard | 180 | 720 | 900 |
| Premium | 360 | 1440 | 1800 |

### Step 3: Monthly Cost by Component

| Tier | Input Cost | Output Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Budget | 9,000 | 45,000 |
| Standard | 4,500 | 22,500 |
| Premium | 1,500 | 7,500 |

### Step 4: Total Monthly Cost

| Tier | Total Monthly Cost |
|---|---|
| Budget | 45,300 |
| Standard | 23,400 |
| Premium | 9,300 |

### Step 5: Annual & Per-Email Costs

| | Budget Tier | Standard Tier | Premium Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Annual cost | 543,600 | 280,800 | 111,600 |
| Cost per email | 1.51 | 0.78 | 0.31 |
| Cost per performant email | 2.157143 | 0.917647 | 0.326316 |

### Step 6: Recommendation

> I'd advise the premium tier, since it is the cheapest option in the end because of its success rate, eliminating more labor work.

## Questions

**Question 1:**
> The budget tier makes the most errors, requiring human interventions, which costs a lot more than the tokens.

**Question 2:**
> Companies can be blindsighted by the offer of the cheapest option, not awknowledging other costs. And some might not have such complicated to data to work with, and are very known by the token system and know how to save out unneccesary tokens.

**Question 3:**
> I would lead to the total cost. It gives a more direct pricing, without shocking the CFO later with extra costs. And makes them able to choose the cheapest option in reality.

## Part 4

1. It stays quite the same. Both token cost and error costs scale proportionally with the number of emails.
2. No, premium remains the best and cheapest option in the end.
3. The break-even point would be 29,000 emails/month.
